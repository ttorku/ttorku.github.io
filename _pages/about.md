Greetings from Dr. Thomas Torku. My academic journey, crowned with a Ph.D. in Computational Science, has led me to a dynamic career where I excel as a Quantitative Analyst Associate  Sr. at [JPMorgan Chase & Co.]((https://www.jpmorganchase.com/))â€”the most prominent bank in the U.S. and the world leader in market capitalization. The challenge of developing advanced AI/ML models is at the core of my role. This pursuit bolsters operational efficiency and significantly improves decision-making capabilities. Before joining the ranks at JPMorgan, my career was steeped in academia, with a substantial seven-year tenure as a Lecturer at Middle Tennessee State University [(MTSU)](https://www.mtsu.edu/), USA (United States of America).  My responsibilities included educating students in introductory Mathematics courses in the University Studies department. I further enriched my teaching portfolio by co-instructing a data science boot camp, where I had the privilege of shepherding students through the intricacies of data science, acquainting them with Python programming, and mentoring them through their capstone projects, which has impacted over 150 students.
