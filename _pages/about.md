My name is Mr. Thomas Torku, a Ph.D. computational science candidate at Middle Tennessee State University [MTSU](https://www.mtsu.edu/), USA (United States of America). As a data scientist and computational researcher, I am keenly interested in disease modeling which includes epidemic models, stochastic modeling, quantitative analysis, big data analysis and cloud computing. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Abdul Khaliq](https://www.mtsu.edu/faculty/akhaliq/). I teach for the University Studies at MTSU (Middle Tennessee State University): College Algebra and Math for General Studies. Making an impact on people's lives is one of my core values. During Fall 2022, I co-instructed various students across Africa for a 12-week Data Science Boothcamp organized by [Muzedata](https://www.muzedata.com/) and [DLYA](https://www.dlya.org/), where over 150 students were exposed to fundamentals in data science using Python. Due to my desire to make greater impact in the field of data science, I landed a summer internship at [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/). During the internship I worked with large datasets, built prediction models, and horned in on my presentation skills.
